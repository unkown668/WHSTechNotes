technolgy is very helpful in many of different ways some benfit some don't but in some ways technology helps us humans is that is can inform us such as when there is a kidnapping or something the police send out a alarm to inform people 
to help find the missing person that has been kidnapped and provde as much information as they possible can and a another can is that when there is a hurricane or such as the way they use there sirens to inform people about the natural 
disaster so they are aware that they need to take shelter and or that they need to find high ground becuase the sirens is a form of technolgy.
