My design was made to help inform people about the shoes that they aquire such as what materials its made with the marketing the prices of shoes and or shipping so when people buy shoes they will be informed of everything and as a fellow shoe fien i personally know how much we love to watch the market to see if we have profited or if we have lots money and we like to see the type of material we put on our feet but over all the deisgn of the app is to inform people about shoes like the prices and the material becuase some materials can be harmful but this app will keep you informed constanly and will care and support you and or help in any of your wonders of shoes or what you are putting on your feet and it isw also gonna help people stay informed for when a new hsoe comes out so they dont miss out on a fire drop or a trash drop and they will always be informed if the new crappy tariffs change and how much they affect the average cost of such if they buy from another website or if they buy out of there state and this article includes the reason why our shoes are so expensive if someone was wondering or think it is dumb to spend around 250$ for one pair of shoes seeing as that is the average cost of Jordan 4's now adays but i think this will help people see and stay informed so this is why i choice this to help many of people that need the help or dont understand the hype that others feel and once informed it should make the market of shoes sky rocket i feel becuase many of people stay uninformed and it causes people to not spend money on good material stuff and a pair of history.

technolgy is very helpful in many of different ways some benfit some don't but in some ways technology helps us humans is that is can inform us such as when there is a kidnapping or something the police send out a alarm to inform people 
to help find the missing person that has been kidnapped and provde as much information as they possible can and a another can is that when there is a hurricane or such as the way they use there sirens to inform people about the natural 
disaster so they are aware that they need to take shelter and or that they need to find high ground becuase the sirens is a form of technolgy.

the biggest deal i feel is snap runs out of funding it will affect struggling veterans and or single mothers that barely make it by and single struggling fathers
technolgy could help by promoting the food banks so people that arent aware become aware and can get the help they need either for themselves or for there kids
when some poeple dont have anyway to get or see stuff that is only on technolgy that is why signs and bill boards help some could and may promote the food banks themselves so more poeple come and get taken care of 
my idea would be called fast food and the way you get it is you tell your struggles and what is happening and you get a instant amount of money to buy food depending on your problem the AI system will give out a good amonut and required amonut so you have what youi need to survie and what not for your kids and its like uber or what not it gets dropped off to you if you dont have a car and the driver gets paided by the app while you get your free food but the food can only be stuff to cook or snacks and the system will only allow struggling people to get funding others will be denied and for secruity of a corrupt code we will or i will add a nasa grade level fire wall and will build it and code it.

drones are used for helping our miltary in combat and taking out units that would cost many of lifes and can help soilders scout out the area around them and see the enemy in battle, the programmers that are drone software engeinners and embedded systems software enginners, the enginners each get around 60k-116k per year, the enginners need strong Computer Science/Engineering degrees (BS minimum) and skills in C/C++, Python, for flight control & apps, plus Aerospace/Avionics knowledge, with certifications like FAA Part 107 (for civilian side) and specific military training (like AFIT) in the future i would like to do this job becuase it will be a intersting adventure to do in the miltary and help my beatiful and amazing country america
