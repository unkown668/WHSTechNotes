My design was made to help inform people about the shoes that they aquire such as what materials its made with the marketing the prices of shoes and or shipping so when people buy shoes they will be informed of everything and as a fellow shoe fien i personally know how much we love to watch the market to see if we have profited or if we have lots money and we like to see the type of material we put on our feet but over all the deisgn of the app is to inform people about shoes like the prices and the material becuase some materials can be harmful but this app will keep you informed constanly and will care and support you and or help in any of your wonders of shoes or what you are putting on your feet and it isw also gonna help people stay informed for when a new hsoe comes out so they dont miss out on a fire drop or a trash drop and they will always be informed if the new crappy tariffs change and how much they affect the average cost of such if they buy from another website or if they buy out of there state and this article includes the reason why our shoes are so expensive if someone was wondering or think it is dumb to spend around 250$ for one pair of shoes seeing as that is the average cost of Jordan 4's now adays but i think this will help people see and stay informed so this is why i choice this to help many of people that need the help or dont understand the hype that others feel and once informed it should make the market of shoes sky rocket i feel becuase many of people stay uninformed and it causes people to not spend money on good material stuff and a pair of history.
